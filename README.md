# MVCly

A small MVC framework with a standalone HTTP server (Netty), template engine (Velocity), and very basic IOC; it starts a web server, and it's ready for requests in around 3 seconds on a Raspberry Pi-like server.

I created this framework because I wanted something basic and lightweight to build my web applications without complex dependencies or front-end frameworks.
